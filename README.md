# MyTasks

MyTasks is a collaborative, full‑stack task management app designed to make small‑team planning fast and intuitive. It blends a minimal, modern UI with practical features like Kanban boards, sprints, and lightweight team management so groups can organize work without overhead.

## What It Does
- Team spaces: Create a team, invite or join via a short code, and see members at a glance.
- Tasks: Add, prioritize, and track tasks with simple statuses (to‑do, in‑progress, done).
- Kanban board: Drag‑and‑drop columns with optional WIP limits to keep work focused.
- Sprints: Group tasks into time‑boxed iterations and track progress.
- Auth: Basic email/password login with cookie‑based sessions.

## How It’s Built
- Frontend: React (Vite) with a clean, dark UI designed for clarity and speed.
- Backend: Node.js + Express with REST endpoints for users, teams, tasks, boards, and sprints.
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose models and indexes tuned for common queries.

## Philosophy
Keep collaboration simple. MyTasks focuses on the essentials—teams, tasks, boards, and sprints—so people can plan and execute without wrestling complex tooling.
